## Hello World
This program is just a test program to make sure your java is working.

Try to run the Main method.

## Bare basic minimum information
Java, like many programming languages, requires lines of code to end with semi-colons. This tells the compiler to stop reading that line and process it. Similar to entering a new line on a type writer.
That is because, the white space (tab, space, enter, etc.) make our programs look pretty and easy to read, but they don't affect how the code runs.

If you miss a semi-colon on a line you will notice a red underline, if you are in a properly set up IDE. This shows a compilation error, IDEs catch this for you before compilation to save you time and trouble.
Some errors, however, are run-time. This means the program only breaks when you try to run it, but it will compile just fine. An example of this is like a list of numbers; say there are 10 numbers but you ask the computer to show you the 11th number. There is no such number in your list, so when the computer receives that command it will break. This is run-time, because the computer knows how to fetch numbers and does not know how many numbers are in the list until the code actually runs.

On top of that, there are semantic and syntactic errors. Those will be explained next lesson.

You will also notice that some lines don't even have semi-colons at the end. These lines will end (or at least be followed by) a curly brace such as "{" or "}".
These determine the beginning and ending of code blocks. Blocks of code delimit the lines of code into segments that can be replicated or called upon on demand. Think of them as if putting papers into folders, and the program itself is a filing cabinet.

Lastly, we have "import" lines. These tell the program to pull in other code you need to run whatever you are working on. Programming in a high level language is not like writing code from scratch, if that were the case we would have to program which serial bus to read and write to, how to interpret signals and kernel commands, and all this craziness. The beauty of using these programming languages is that the hard work is done for us and all we have to do is pull in what we need when we need it.
Think of it as if you had to reference one of your or someone else's previous papers when writing a paper as a source; you don't rewrite the whole paper or prove the conclusion of that paper again - it stands alone. Instead, depending on the format, you just include the paper in your works cited and you mention the citation in-line when you need.

This metaphor is great because it explains 2 concepts: imports and references. The import is the inline citation, used in each sentence as needed, but regardless it must exist in the works cited.
The works cited is the references/libraries in use. The entire program must know what the program is and have access to its code to use it, even if you don't import it everywhere.

That should be it, you may not understand what you are looking at but as long as you run it and see output that makes sense, you're good to move on to the first lesson.
